The *notebooks* folder contains python notebooks.  The *data* folder contains data files.  Note that these files have been processed from the raw MPI-ESM files available from [the ESFG](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/).  

* MPI-historical-pattern.ipynb contains Figures 1-7 
* SensitivityDecades.ipynb contains Fig. 8
* 1pct_vs_4xCO2.ipynb contains Figures 9-11

The *process* folder contains scripts that are used on the TAMU system to convert the raw model files into the pre-processed files used by the scripts above.  They will not run with what's provided here â€” you need to download raw model files from the ESGF.  They are provided here to document how the files are pre-processed.
